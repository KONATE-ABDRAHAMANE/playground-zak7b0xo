# Debugging

    There are many things that can go wrong when programming. In Computer Science, we call these "bugs." The most basic categories of bugs are Syntax and Logic
    bugs. 

    Syntax is where you have a typo in your code. This could be forgetting a semi colon (;), curly bracket ({}), or any other symbol required for the code
    to be compiled.
