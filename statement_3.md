# Primitive Variables

Primitive Variables are simple, single value data that we store for later use. In Java, you need to specify the type of variable whenever you declare a new 
variable. However, Java is more forgiving with print statements and variable types. The types of primitive variables are:

    int myInt = 1;
    float myFloat = 1.0f;
    double myDouble = 5.00;
    char myChar = 'A';
    boolean myBoolean = true;

    System.out.println("My int is: " + myInt);
    System.out.println("My float is: " + myFloat);
    System.out.println("My int is: " + myDouble);
    System.out.println("My int is: " + myChar);
    System.out.println("My int is: " + myBoolean);
