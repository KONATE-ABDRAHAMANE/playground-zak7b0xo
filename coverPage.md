# UNDER CONSTRUCTION

# Welcome to Beginner Java Concepts!

And welcome to the wonderful world of Computer Science! So, first off, this playground is "under construction." That means that I'm still working on a few 
things, but there is still value in this guide! 

The main thing I'm working on is adding interactive examples. For now, you can copy the code snippets and run them in your local development environment.
It's a good idea to have a local development environment for any coding language you want to be familiar with. 

# Integraded Development Environment (IDE)

For just starting out, I recommend using Eclipse for your Java IDE. You can download your own copy for free here:

Until I configure the interactive examples, you can copy and paste code into your Eclipse project.

watching the ads and buying subscriptions. YouTube I'm still far off from, but could eventually become a partner.
